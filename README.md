# colorgrid

I built a grid of hsl (hue, saturation, lightness) colors. For each color hue, I create an n x n grid to vary lightness and saturation. 

This project was built to generate a test tapestry - I am ordering a blanket from WOVNS to help me choose colors for future design projects.
Weaving relies heavily on optical mixing to create color variation. For example, a grid of red and yellow threads will look orange from a distance.
Depending upon the thread colors on your loom, certain blended colors can be approximated more successfullly than others.
WOVNS uses red, yellow, green, blue, white, and black threads. I want to see which browns, greys, purples, etc. can be made from these initial colors.
